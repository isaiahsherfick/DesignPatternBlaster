                      test package README:

This is the main test package for the project. All classes need unit tests
for all appropriate methods when they are written. Ideally, the tests are
written before the methods are implemented. After all the unit tests pass,
the class can be added to an integration test. When that's good, test the
class in an end-to-end context and finally merge it to master. Below is
a description of all the test classes in this package.


TestObserver.java:

    Class used for testing which implements Observer. On update(), it
    increments the instance variable counter by 1. This is used to test
    observer/observable interactions without fuddling with the actual
    production classes for the sake of unit tests.

ModelTests.java:
    
    Tests Model.java. Uses TestObserver.java to ensure that
    notifyObservers() is being called correctly. 

SpriteTest.java:

    Tests Sprite.java. Uses GameEvent.java, a few different Behavior.java
    subclasses, EventBehavior.java to test a few methods for Sprite.

GameEventTest.java:

    Tests GameEvent.java. **Every time a new factory method is added to
    GameEvent.java, make sure FactoryMethodTest() gets updated to include
    it!**
