   				    constants package readme:


This package contains only the final class Constants.java which contains
all of the magic numbers we'll use throughout the application. In the
future, we can consider altering Constants.java to read a constants.txt
file so that changes can be made without re-compiling.

When adding a new constant to Constants.java, make sure that you also
include a brief comment explaining where the constant will be used and
what the value actually represents.
