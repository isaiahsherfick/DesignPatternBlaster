    	            physics package readme:


    The physics package contains classes related to physics operations
    present in our game. Right now that is simply a vector class, but we
    may add more in the future.

    Vectors have two components: magnitude and direction (angle). Java
    wants these angles to be in radians, so be sure to use Math.toRadians
    on any calculations you perform which output degrees before
    constructing a vector.

    We'll be using vectors to accomplish diagonal movement with varying
    andles but a constant speed, such as shooting at the player from above
    or launching a command at a subordinate.
