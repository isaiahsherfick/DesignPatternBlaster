    	            model package readme:


The model package contains everything needed for the top-most level of our
model within our MVC architecture. This amounts to Model.java and all of
its various member variables such as SaveAndLoadManager.java and
GameClock.java. Model.java serves as a Mediator of sorts for all of these
objects. Whenever one of them needs a method contained by one of the other
classes, they will instead call the corresponding wrapper method contained
in Model.java so that these objects are all only coupled to Model rather
than being a tangled mess.
