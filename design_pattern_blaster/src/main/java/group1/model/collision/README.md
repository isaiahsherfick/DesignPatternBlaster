Collision package is solely responsible for handling the collisions between sprites. The HitBoxOverlapType.java contains the enums for all the types of collision overlapping that can occur inside the gameplay between one or more sprites. It also contains the HitBox.java file which checks the type of collision by calculating the topleft coordinates and the bottomright coordinates of the current sprite with the secondary sprite. The CollisionManager.java iterates through all the sprites in one layer and checks them with the other sprites in the same layer and then executes the collision behavior for the specific sprite.
