Level ReadeMe:

The level package contains Level.java which contains information about each and every level defined in the game.
Each Level class will have a Level Number and a list of all sprites defined/seen in that level.

The Level Manager class defines two lists Completed Levels and Unfinished Levels. As the player completes the levels, the two lists are updated. The Level Manger gets the Level requested by the user from the Level Class which contains the Level Number and List of all sprites in that level and passes it to the View.
