                    behavior package readme:


    The behavior package contains all of the concrete implementations of
    the behavior interface. Behaviors are the abstraction for how a sprite
    will change state based on some event occuring. They are contained in
    EventBehavior objects which sprites contain as well as within each
    sprite's custom collision map. 

    Whenever a new behavior is added, nothing more than writing tests for
    that specific behavior needs done.
