    	            game_event package readme:


    The game_event package contains the abstraction for game events within
    our system. They are all contained within the GameEvent.java class
    which itself contains factory methods for the instantiation of new
    game events. The only oddball class is the KeyPressEvent, which needs
    to actually store a KeyCode to have any use for us.

    **Whenever a new GameEvent factory method is added, factoryMethodTests()
    in tests.GameEventTest.java needs updated to include that new factory
    method!
