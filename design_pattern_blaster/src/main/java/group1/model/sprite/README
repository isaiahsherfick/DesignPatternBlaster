    	            sprite package readme:


The sprite package contains everything related to sprites within the model
of our game. This includes Sprite.java, SpriteManager.java, and all of the
types which a sprite contains, such as EventBehavior and Animation. 

**Whenever a new GameEvent factory method is added, factoryMethodTests()
in tests.GameEventTest.java needs updated to include that new factory
method!


**Whenever a new field is added to Sprite, here is what needs done:
	1. update default sprite constructor to include that field
	2. add getters/setters for that field
	3. add those fields to save/load
	4. add those fields to sprite copy() (ensure that the new fields have copy() methods themselves if they aren't primitive)
