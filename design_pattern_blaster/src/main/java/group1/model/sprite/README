    	            sprite package readme:


The sprite package contains everything related to sprites within the model
of our game. This includes Sprite.java, SpriteManager.java, and all of the
types which a sprite contains, such as EventBehavior and Animation. 

**Whenever a new GameEvent factory method is added, factoryMethodTests()
in tests.GameEventTest.java needs updated to include that new factory
method!
