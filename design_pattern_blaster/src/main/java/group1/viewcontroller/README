                viewcontroller package readme:

    This package contains the code for the viewcontroller, which is
    a weird thing that we weren't entirely satisfied with  when we were
    conceiving the idea. However, when we realized that our Controller was
    going to entirely consist of getters and setters, we decided to
    simpoly merge it into our view instead of creating an unnecessarily
    complicated callstack for our overall system.
