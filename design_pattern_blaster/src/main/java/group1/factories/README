    	            factories package readme:


    The factories package contains all of our factory classes for easy
    object instantiation. The first factory is SpriteFactory.java,
    which contains a series of factory methods each of which corresponds
    to a sprite that we want to appear in our game. To get a sprite,
    simply ask the SpriteFactory for it, and it will automatically insert
    the sprite into the SpriteManager without the client having to worry
    about it or even be aware of its presence.
    
    The second factory is LevelFactory.java, which uses SpriteFactory to 
    house factory methods for the various levels in our game. App.java then
    uses these methods to quickly construct the levels we want to put into
    the level manager and start up the game with.
