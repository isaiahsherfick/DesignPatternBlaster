    	            factories package readme:


    The factories package contains all of our factory classes for easy
    object instantiation. Currently, that is only SpriteFactory.java,
    which contains a series of factory methods each of which corresponds
    to a sprite that we want to appear in our game. To get a sprite,
    simply ask the SpriteFactory for it, and it will automatically insert
    the sprite into the SpriteManager without the client having to worry
    about it or even be aware of its presence.
