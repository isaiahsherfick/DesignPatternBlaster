                            PROJECT README:

All packages must contain a README file which will be maintained. These
files will describe the purpose of the package, its contents in brief
detail, and any information that someone making a change or adding to it
needs to know to do so quickly and painlessly. (Ex: "To add a new Shape
Strategy, you need to make sure you also change ShapeLoader.java and
StrategyList.java as well as adding it to the dropdown in View.java").

Upon creating a new class, a new corresponding test class needs created
for that class. Every single method in the class needs a unit test which
tests just that method. The README file in the class's package needs 
updated as well as the README file in the test package. Thorough comments
when you write the code is best practice, as we have significantly more
time with this project than any of the others we've completed so far.

After the class is "done," it needs added to an appropriate integration 
test where that class will be used. After the integration tests pass, 
launch the application and ensure that it behaves as expected with an 
end-to-end test. 

Once per day, you are required to merge master into your branch and
resolve any merge conflicts. After performing that merge, run your tests.
If they all pass, checkout master and merge your branch back into master.
Do not merge your branch into master unless your tests pass or you've
consulted the group.
