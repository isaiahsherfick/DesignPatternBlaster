    	            interface package readme:


The interface package is home to all interfaces in our project. Generally
speaking, we want our interfaces to be as specific as possible. In order
to avoid violating the Liskov Substitution Principle, every class which
implements an interface should have an implementation which makes sense
for each and every method in the interface. If we're about to create
a class which uses some, but not all, of the methods in an interface, we
need to split that interface into some kind of hierarchy to avoid giving
our classes dummy methods.
