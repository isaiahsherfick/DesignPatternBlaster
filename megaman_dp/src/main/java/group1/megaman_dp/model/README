    	            model package readme:


The model package contains everything needed for the top-most level of our
model within our MVC architecture. This amounts to Model.java and then the
subpackages within model such as save_load, sprite, and level. The model
should only really be responsible for gathering all of the various
managers into one place and serving as a mediator between them all when
necessary. It will receive commands from the Controller to perform these
actions. It will also implement the Observable interface so that the view
automatically updates as changes are made to the model.
