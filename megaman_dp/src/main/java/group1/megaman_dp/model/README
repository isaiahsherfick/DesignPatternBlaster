    	            model package readme:


The model package contains everything needed for the top-most level of our
model within our MVC architecture. This amounts to Model.java and all of
its various member variables such as SaveAndLoadManager.java and
GameClock.java. Model.java serves as a Mediator for all of these objects,
so whenever one of them needs a reference to another, they call the getter
from Model. This will hopefully prevent our system's flow from being too
spaghettified.
