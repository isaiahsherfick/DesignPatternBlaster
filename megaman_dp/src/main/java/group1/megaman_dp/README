    	            megaman_dp package readme:


Aside from all the subpackages, this package contains App.java, where main() 
is located, and mainWindow.fxml, the FXML file which contains the layout 
details for our main window of the game. Changes to that window need to 
be done through the FXML file whenever possible.
